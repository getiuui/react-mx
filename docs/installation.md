Once installed, import the `ReactMX` component from the `react-mx` package and place it on a new page of your react app. You can specify the components to use by manually passing the `components` prop to the `ReactMX` instance (see below) or automatically by adding your `react-mx-watcher` script to your npm package.json

ReactMX will allow you to drag-and-drop your componets to the "stage", modify their props, aggregate them and then save the result as a new compoponent
