<h2 id="what-is-react-mx">🤔 What is React MX?</h2>

React-MX is a drop-in visual component editor that lets you build new React components from scratch, by using your already existing components or any 3rd party libraries.

<h2 id="how-it-works">⚙️ How it works?</h2>

Once installed, import the `ReactMX` component from the `react-mx` package and place it on a new page of your react app. You can specify the components to use by manually passing the `components` prop to the `ReactMX` instance (see below) or automatically by adding your `react-mx-watcher` script to your npm package.json

ReactMX will allow you to drag-and-drop your componets to the "stage", modify their props, aggregate them and then save the result as a new compoponent

<h2 id="features">🔥 Features</h2>

- *directly integrated in your project* - ReactMX runs *inside* your project environment
- *100% offline* - build, mock and tweak your components from anywhere, no internet or external resources needed
- *Preview your components* - Present your components
- *Easy prop values manipulation* - react-mx lets you define the type of control to be used to alter a specific prop
- *automatic prop controls* - out of the box, most common props are automatically mapped to controlls (eg: styles, children, key etc)

<h2 id="setup">🚀 Setup</h2>

Install the `react-mx` package:

```
yarn add react-mx

or

npm i react-mx
```
